j-léger is a JavaScript DOM manipulation library inspired by jQuery. Its functions enable users to do the following:

* Traverse and manipulate the DOM;
* Add and remove event handlers to DOM nodes / HTML elements;
* Queue up callback functions to be executed after the HTML has finished rendering; and
* Perform simple HTTP (ajax) requests.
